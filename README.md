This is the activity 29 RPSSL.

The code is in the file named "Program.cs". Additionally, the file "Flowchart RSSL" shows the flowchart for the game/coding.

The coding is based on the description i activity 29 where the following code was given and copied into the answer:
foreach (var p1 in Enum.GetValues<Shape>())
foreach (var p2 in Enum.GetValues<Shape>())
    Console.WriteLine($"If p1: {p1} and p2: {p2}  => ");
    // Print Win lose or tie.
